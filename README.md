# CNN on FPGA
Welcome to the repository for our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation on FPGA using High-Level Synthesis (HLS)!

# Project Description:
Our repository aims to provide an optimized implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an FPGA using High-Level Synthesis (HLS).

# Current Status:
Please note that the code in this repository is still a work in progress. While we have made some progress on the CNN implementation, there are functionalities and optimizations that are not yet complete.

# Installation and Usage:
As of now, the complete installation and usage instructions are not available. We will provide detailed instructions once the code reaches a more mature and stable state.

# Feedback and Support:
If you have any suggestions, ideas, or encounter any issues with the existing code, feel free to open an issue or get in touch with us.
